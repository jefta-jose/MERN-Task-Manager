A robust backend API for a Task Management application built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, following clean architecture principles.

## Features

- **User Authentication**
  - JWT-based login/signup
  - Profile image upload
  - Protected routes with middleware

- **Task Management**
  - Create, read, update, and delete tasks
  - Task status tracking
  - User-task relationships

- **Advanced Functionality**
  - Redis caching for expensive queries
  - Excel report generation
  - API documentation

- **Clean Architecture**
  - Separation of concerns (Routes, Controllers, Services)
  - Helper functions and middleware
  - Proper error handling

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas
- **Cache**: Redis (Docker container)
- **Reporting**: ExcelJS
- **API Testing**: Postman, ApiDog

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:jefta-jose/MERN-Task-Manager.git
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`:
   ```
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_atlas_uri
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   REDIS_URL=redis://:<your_secure_password>@localhost:6379
   PORT=8000
   ```

4. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## API Documentation

### Authentication Routes
- `POST /api/auth/register` - Register a new user
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Login existing user
- `GET /api/auth/profile` - Get current user profile (Protected)
- `PUT /api/auth/profile` - Update user profile (Protected)

### User Management
- `GET /api/users` - Get all users (Admin only)
- `GET /api/users/admins` - Get all admin users (Admin only)
- `GET /api/users/:id` - Get specific user by ID
- `DELETE /api/users/:id` - Delete user (Admin only)

### Task Management
- `GET /api/tasks/dashboard-data` - Get dashboard analytics (Protected)
- `GET /api/tasks/user-dashboard-data` - Get user-specific dashboard data (Protected)
- `GET /api/tasks` - Get all tasks (Protected)
- `GET /api/tasks/:id` - Get specific task by ID (Protected)
- `POST /api/tasks` - Create new task (Admin only, Protected)
- `PUT /api/tasks/:id` - Update task (Protected)
- `DELETE /api/tasks/:id` - Delete task (Admin only, Protected)
- `PUT /api/tasks/:id/status` - Update task status (Protected)
- `PUT /api/tasks/:id/todo` - Update task checklist (Protected)

### Report Generation (Admin Only)
- `GET /api/reports/export/tasks` - Export all tasks as PDF (Admin only)
- `GET /api/reports/export/users` - Export user-task report (Admin only)

**Note**: All routes marked as "Protected" require valid JWT authentication. "Admin only" routes require admin privileges.

## Challenges & Solutions

### 1. Undefined req.body
**Issue**: Request body was undefined in routes  
**Solution**: Added proper Express body parsers:
```javascript
app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
```

### 2. MongoDB Atlas Access
**Issue**: Connecting to cloud database  
**Solution**: Configured IP access in Atlas dashboard to allow connections from my IP while maintaining authentication.

### 3. Image Uploads
**Issue**: Postman file uploads failing  
**Solution**: Discovered the need to use `image` as the form-data key when uploading files.

### 4. Performance Optimization
- Implemented Redis caching for expensive queries
- Used `Promise.all()` for parallel async operations
- Utilized `.populate()` for MongoDB document references

## Learning Highlights

- MongoDB operations (`find`, `create`, `populate`)
- Redis caching with Docker
- Excel report generation with ExcelJS
- Clean architecture implementation
- Proper error handling and response messaging

## Future Improvements

- Implement task categories and tags
- Add task commenting system
- Introduce task deadlines and reminders
- Enhance reporting capabilities
- Implement rate limiting
